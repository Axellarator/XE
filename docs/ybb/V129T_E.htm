     1.BUGs
	   -It can't change sc line on =0.1 screen.
		Setting for S+C and S+A do no work, and same effect as setting of without S+.
        Accodingly, Cut & Paste by mouse dose not work.
	   -=Deleting a line on the =0.2 screen causes corrupted key binding.

     2.Additional function.
       -Syntax Highlight.
		Supports ANSI:reverse attributes of Andre Simon's Highlight and GNU source-highlight.
		Also, by specifying C_UNDERLINE=R/G_UNDERLINE=R in xesynl.cfg/::xesynl.cfg,
        you can get reverse effect for underline attribute.
	   -Unicode support for CID prefix.
	    U-235d(ÅH) is a comment prefix in APL language, CID supports it.
		You can also set the extensions to apply by specifying the following in the ::xe.ini file:
          Change_ID_Type_4  = 60 = u-235d= APL
		With this setting, you can specify APL by CID type like as "CID on APL"
        When using Unicode, the display width varies depending on the language environment,
        so be careful when sharing the file.
        For example, if Windows displays by 2 columns and Linux displays 1 column,
        the CID tagged to the update line on Windows is not recognized as CID on Linux.
        So the "cid clear" command on Linux may return 0 rows.

     3.Miscellaneous.
	   -Windows Terminal seems to have become the default command prompt PGM in Windows 11.
        Line commands may cause problems.
        Use old command prompt PGM c:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe.
	   -Added NOAPPEND option for easier resetting of APPEND in -CID command.
	   -Support comment description starting with "#" on =0.1 screen.
	   -Review =0.2 and =0.3 screen.
		Box-line character default is changed and added character by unicode.
	   -(Win) Changed default location of work directory from C:\ to C:\users\[username]\.
        If you already have C:\xe_wd, it continue to be used, it is applied from new installation.
